              <h1>Ashwin Reddy</h1>
              <p>Ashwin is a senior majoring in Human Biology and minoring in Modern Languages. He enjoys learning about how the physiology of the brain translates to different human behaviors, and how behaviors can change over time. These interests compelled him to co-found Stanford Alzheimer's Alliance. While families of dementia patients often see what is lost in their loved ones, Ashwin loves how volunteers can bring a fresh perspective and appreciate the deeply human characteristics that remain intact. Along with being the president of Stanford Alzheimer’s Alliance this year, Ashwin is an Outdoors Leader for Stanford Outdoor Outreach Program, a Tutor for Stanford Habla, and an interpreter and pre-clinician at the Pacific Free Clinics. In his spare time, he loves to work out, watch movies, and embrace the outdoors!

        <h2>About Us</h2>
       <p> Millions of individuals are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease and neurodegenerative dementia. The goal of the Stanford Alzheimer’s Alliance (SAA), founded in 2017 by a group of Stanford undergraduates, is to build meaningful, lasting relationships between college students and nursing home residents who are living with Alzheimer’s Disease or other forms of dementia during weekly one-on-one visits. We strive to break through the profound isolation and social disengagement imposed by Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia and promote awareness of these neurodegenerative conditions. The SAA is recognized as a Voluntary Student Organization by Stanford’s Office of Student Engagement and is currently in the process of being certified as a Cardinal Commitment through the Haas Center for Public Service. We are also a recipient of a Haas Center Social Impact Grant.

        <h2>Membership</h2>
       <p> New members are recruited to the organization every fall and are expected to commit to the program for at least an entire year. In order to express interest, we ask that students fill out an application with questions regarding their interests in volunteering and working with Alzheimer’s Disease. All of our student members are current Stanford undergraduates. Students of all class years are represented. While many of our volunteers are interested in pursuing a career in medicine or healthcare, our students come from a wide diversity of backgrounds, with majors ranging from Art History to Public Policy.
